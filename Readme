Execution files and director. 
1. ./a.out (binary)
2. ./tv_crawler.conf  (configuration file , contains url and channel names) added so that we can run multiple instances of a.out in separate director and with separate conf file for simultaneours execution. 
#3. ./output (directory) this directory should be made manually. all the output is stored here
4. ./tvshow-db.sql defines the db schema.
5. ./tvshow.db will be created on executing the binary, it will contain the tv schedule data.
